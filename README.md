React Project Rewrite
This project was originally written using SASS and JavaScript. It has now been rewritten using React, where each section of the site is broken down into individual components found in the components folder. The project uses Vite for development, and you can run it locally using the command npm run dev.

Features
React for building components
Vite for fast development environment
Rewritten JavaScript code into reusable React components
SASS used for styling, with final compilation into a single CSS file
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

components: Contains all the individual components of the site.
scss: Contains separate SASS files for each section of the site. These files are imported into the main style.scss file.
style.scss: The main styling file that compiles all required styles for the project.
In this project, all the SASS files are compiled into one CSS file, so thereâ€™s no need for the scss files in the main project. However, the scss folder is still included for you to use or modify if needed.
